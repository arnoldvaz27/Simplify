## About ![About](https://img.shields.io/badge/Simplify-About-orange)
Simplify is an Android Library that consists of different methods that can be used to make development more smoother and the developer has to write less code in order to get the output

## How to use Simplify in my Android Project ![Doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-Only%20For%20Latest%20Release%20Version-red) ![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stable%20Release-Version%201.1-violet)
Add JitPack in your **root** ***build.gradle*** at the end of repositories:

 ## For Gradle

```gradle
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
 ```
 OR just copy the below code and paste in the ***repositories***
 ```gradle
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

  Add the dependency in your **app *build.gradle***:
 
 ```gradle
 	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.arnoldvaz27:Simplify:1.1''
	}
 ```
  OR just copy the below code and paste in the ***build.gradle***
```gradle
implementation 'com.github.arnoldvaz27:Simplify:1.1'
```
 
 
 ## For Maven
   ```gradle
 	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>
		    	https://jitpack.io
		    </url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
   ```

   ```
    
 Add the dependency:
  ```gradle
	libraryDependencies += "com.github.arnoldvaz27" % "Simplify" % "1.1"
 ```
 ## For Leiningen
 Add it in your project.clj at the end of repositories:
   ```gradle
 	 :repositories [["jitpack" "https://jitpack.io"]]
   ```
   
 Add the dependency:
  ```gradle
	:dependencies [[com.github.arnoldvaz27/Simplify "1.1"]]

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use Github Pull Requests (PRs) for this purpose. We recommend you read this guide if you haven't created a Pull Request before.
[Pull request guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Before making any changes, we recommend opening an issue (if one doesn't already exist) and discussing your proposed changes. This way, we can give you feedback and validated the proposed changes. If the changes are minor (simple bug fix of documentation fix), then feel free to open a PR without discussion.

## Verification and Acceptance of Pull Requests ![Verification and Acceptance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Simplify-Important%20Note-red)

1.	Pull requests will be accepted if the code modified is a valid or necessary
2.	Before acceptance, the code will be tested and then it will merged within the branch
3.  After the code is merged the pull requests will be closed
4.  User can not send multiple pull request/ updation code, else this will result in closing all the pull request without further testing process
5.  You can also give screenshots or suggestion for updating the read me file of this project
6.  The request for screenshots or updation the read me file will also be verified as per the above mentioned points.
